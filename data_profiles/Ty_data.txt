images/ty.jpg	      Jun ‘TY‘ Tae Yang, also known as “BaBy“, is a Terran player from South Korea. TY was one of the youngest, if not the youngest pro gamer ever, having been drafted by team WeMade FOX at age 12. Roughly two years later, TY made his first appearance in a televised match, during the GOMTV TG Sambo-Intel Classic Season 1 where he managed to win in the two first rounds. He then started to appear in Proleague on a regular basis, showing average performances. The young player eventually made a name for himself in 2009, when he reached the round of 16 of the 2009 GOMTV Averatec Intel Classic Season 3, defeating JangBi in the process. TY attended his first foreign tournament at the 2014 DreamHack Open Bucharest, where he was widely regarded as a favorite to win the entire tournament. However, in just one of several upsets of the weekend, he fell 1-2 to MC in the round of 16. Since then he has managed to continue to place decently well within various GSL and SSL tournaments. Most recently in 2016 his unpredictable play style and being able to destabilize his opponents has not only contributed to his success but also made his matches a favorite to watch. Along with his impressive play throughout 2016 he managed to earn enough points to secure a spot at the 2016 WCS Global Playoffs at BlizzCon. 	images/splyce.jpg	<img class="rSymbol" src="./images/zerg_logo.svg"> Zerg	13th - 1700pts. 	11	 2-0	 7-1	 1-2	 2	 <td>.vs Impact <img class="rSymbol" src="./images/zerg_logo.svg"></td>	 <td>vs. GuMiho <img class="rSymbol" src="./images/terran_logo.svg">, W2-0</td>	 Jun "TY" Tae Yang - Team Splyce	ty
