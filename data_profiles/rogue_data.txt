./images/player_rogue.jpg	Lee "Rogue" Byung Ryul is a StarCraft II progamer from South Korea. Formerly known as "Savage", and is a Zerg player currently playing for Jin Air Green Wings. He formerly played as "Ryul2" on the Brood War team Hwaseung Oz. Rogue first showed flashes of the greatness in 2015, making the Round of 8 in five separate premier events, though he was unable to advance further. 2017 was the year Rogue delivered on his great promise, as his meteoric rise in the latter part of the year saw him win successive tournaments at IEM Shanghai and GSL Super Tournament II, allowing him to sneak into the WCS Global Finals at the 11th hour. His hot streak proved to be no fluke; Rogue would battle his way through the best competition in the world to take home the BlizzCon trophy in a tightly fought, 4-2 series win over soO, cementing his place as World Champion.	./images/jinair.jpg	<img class="rSymbol" src="./images/zerg_logo.svg"> Zerg 	4th - 3725pts.	5 	5-0	2-2	2-2	0	<td>.vs Byul <img class="rSymbol" src="./images/zerg_logo.svg"></td> 	<td>vs. INnoVation <img class="rSymbol" src="./images/terran_logo.svg">, L1-3</td>	Lee "Rogue" Byung Ryul	rogue
