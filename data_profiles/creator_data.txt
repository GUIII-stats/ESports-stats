In April 2011, Creator made his first appearance in Code A during GSL May, while being only 14 years old at the time. After defeating Leenock in a close 2-1 series, he proceeded to lose to Ryung 1-2 in the round of 16. One month later, his Code A status earned him a spot in the 2011 GSL Super Tournament, and he was matched against Mvp in the round of 64. Albeit showing strong, solid play, he was unable to overcome the Incredible Miracle Terran, and was eliminated from the Super Tournament after losing 1-2. 	./images/jinair.jpg 	<img class="rSymbol" src="./images/protoss_logo.svg"> Protoss 	32nd - 275pts. 	2 	1-1	1-1	1-2	0	<td>TBD</td>	<td>.vs INnoVation <img class="rSymbol" src="./images/terran_logo.svg">, L0-2</td> 	Jang "Creator" Hyun Woo 	creator
