./images/solar.jpg	       Kang ‘Solar’ Min Soo is a StarCraft II Zerg pro gamer from South Korea. Since the beginnings of the Beta of Legacy of the Void, Solar showed top-level performances in online tournaments, winning 6 Leifeng Cups and 3 Lycan League Weekly events, and taking a win at the SHOUTcraft Invitational II dropping only 2 games in his victorious run. In the first Premier Tournament of the Legacy of the Void era, the DreamHack: ROCCAT LotV Championship, Solar came as one of the favorites to claim the final victory. Solar started out strong, after stomping the Group Stage with a perfect 5-0 matches count, not dropping a single map (10-0). Eventually it came down to an intense nail-biting 7 games finals, with him being down 1-3, but Solar managed to come back and win the tournament 4-3 claiming the $20,000 prize. More recently in 2016 Solar performed decently in both GSL seasons but his most impressive placements and plays came out of each SpoTV StarLeague seasons – placing 3rd in Season 1 and then taking the 1st place trophy in Season 2 solidifying his place at the 2016 WCS Global Playoffs at BlizzCon.	./images/splyce.jpg	<img class="rSymbol" src="./images/zerg_logo.svg"> Zerg 	7th (1200 points)	8th - 2250pts.	 3-0	2-1	 4-2 	 W2	 <td>TBD</td> 	 <td>vs. uThermal <img class="rSymbol" src="./images/terran_logo.svg">,W2-0</td> 	Kang "Solar" Min Soo - Team Splyce	solar
